		Our primary method in achieving our mission is by getting our members involved in our project
		curriculums. For all projects, we have info sessions at the beginning of every academic year and
		release applications around the same time. If you are interested in learning more about our
		projects, visit <a href="projects.ieeebruins.com" class="text-primary"
			>projects.ieeebruins.com</a
		> to get the public resources that we have for each! Feel free to use these resources as inspiration

		Our OPS program is designed to provide hands-on foundational knowledge in the field of tech and
		hardware. We assume you know absolutely nothing, and build your knowledge from the ground up.
		Throughout the year, students will be challenged to complete 2-3 small projects per quarter that
		will allow you to apply the skills you have learned.
